# Network-Subnetting-with-VLSM-DHCP-OSPF-Routing-and-Access-Control
This project uses VLSM for efficient IP allocation across three subnets with DHCP for dynamic IP assignment and OSPF for routing. A second network configuration restricts communication between a new PC in Network A and Network C using access control. Network address: 192.16.2.0.
